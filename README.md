#  ðŸ’Š Personalized-Medicine-Recommending-System ðŸ’Š

The Personalized Medicine Recommending System is a software solution designed to assist healthcare professionals, particularly doctors, in recommending personalized medicine based on patient symptoms. The system utilizes a dataset containing crucial patient information, such as name, date of birth, gender, symptoms, causes, diagnosed disease, and prescribed medicine. By leveraging data imputation techniques, the system ensures that missing values in the dataset are handled appropriately, allowing for a comprehensive and accurate analysis.
